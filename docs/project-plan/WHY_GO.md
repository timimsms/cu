# Why Go + Cobra for `cu`

## Executive Summary
Go + Cobra is the recommended stack for building the initial implementation of the `cu` ClickUp CLI. It balances performance, ease of distribution, robust ecosystem support, and direct parity with the GitHub CLI (`gh`). This document outlines the rationale and trade-offs to guide and justify our choice.

## Why Go + Cobra?

### 1. Proven CLI Model
Goâ€™s Cobra framework powers industry-standard tools including:
- `gh` (GitHub CLI)
- `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI)
- `hugo` (static site generator)

This ensures our team and contributors can reference battle-tested patterns and documentation while inheriting a familiar command structure.

### 2. Single Binary Distribution
- **Zero runtime dependencies**
- Fully static binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Ideal for:
  - **Homebrew packaging**
  - **Docker images (<15 MB Alpine)**
  - **CI/CD agent installs**

### 3. Plugin-Friendly
- Like `kubectl`, Cobra allows dynamic loading of executables matching the `cu-<subcommand>` naming pattern.
- Enables community or team-specific extensions without altering the core CLI.

### 4. Performance and Footprint
- Millisecond cold start
- <10MB static binary
- Low memory usage (great for CI, remote agents, serverless hooks)

### 5. ClickUp SDK Availability
- Community-maintained SDKs:
  - [`go-clickup`](https://github.com/ryanuber/go-clickup)
  - [`clickup-client-go`](https://github.com/EnricoMi/clickup-client-go)
- Already support most endpoints (Tasks, Lists, Spaces)

### 6. GoReleaser Integration
- **Cross-compilation** for all major OS/arch targets
- Seamless **npm tarball**, **Homebrew bottle**, and **GitHub Releases** packaging
- Built-in **SBOM**, changelog, and signing support

### 7. Security & Supply Chain
- Minimal transitive dependencies
- Use `govulncheck`, `gosec`, and Go module verification for auditability

### 8. Long-Term Viability
- Strong corporate and OSS community backing
- Low churn, high tooling stability
- Easy to onboard contributors from other Go-based CLIs

## Trade-Offs
| Concern                        | Mitigation                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Steeper learning curve        | Provide contributor docs; pair with experienced Go devs initially         |
| Larger than Bash equivalents  | Still significantly smaller and faster than Node/Ruby-based CLIs          |
| POSIX `cu` name conflict      | Use `clickup` as binary; provide `cu` symlink opt-in post-install         |
| Ruby-first team preference    | Shell out to Go binary or expose lightweight Ruby wrapper post-MVP        |

---

## Strategic Fit
- Aligns with GitHub CLI architecture
- Supports our multi-platform packaging strategy (brew + npm)
- Facilitates agentic and automation-friendly workflows
- Keeps the MVP small, fast, and CI-ready

---

## Recommendation
**Proceed with a Go 1.22 + Cobra-based implementation for `cu`.**

Initial implementation priorities:
1. Scaffold with Cobra
2. Integrate `go-clickup` for auth and basic task CRUD
3. Set up GoReleaser for CI, Homebrew, and npm publishing
4. Publish Docker image with CLI preinstalled
5. Benchmark against `gh` for command latency and memory

This positions us for a stable and extensible v1 release with strong foundations for the broader ClickUp CLI ecosystem.
