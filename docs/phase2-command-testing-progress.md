# Phase 2: Command Testing Progress

## Summary

We've made significant progress in Phase 2 of our test coverage improvement plan. Here's what we've accomplished:

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created API Mock Infrastructure ✅
- Comprehensive mock API client in `internal/api/mock/`
- Mock UserLookup service
- Test fixtures for common API scenarios
- Support for error simulation and call tracking

### 2. Tested Commands ✅
- **Config commands**: Basic structure and metadata tests
- **Task commands**: Command structure validation
- **List commands**: Command existence and subcommand tests
- **API command**: Already had basic tests

### 3. Test Approach
Due to the tight coupling of commands with their dependencies (direct API client creation), we focused on:
- Command structure validation
- Flag existence and metadata
- Subcommand registration
- Basic command properties

## Coverage Improvement

- **CMD Package**: 7.6% → 17.9% coverage
- **Overall**: 16.5% → 17.9% coverage

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Tight Coupling
Commands create their dependencies directly in the Run function:
```go
client, err := api.NewClient()
```
This makes unit testing with mocks difficult without refactoring.

### 2. Direct os.Exit Usage
Many commands use `os.Exit(1)` directly, making it hard to test error paths.

### 3. Complex Command Logic
Commands mix:
- Argument parsing
- API calls
- Output formatting
- Error handling

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. Dependency Injection
Refactor commands to accept interfaces:
```go
type TaskCommand struct {
    client api.ClientInterface
    output output.FormatterInterface
}
```

### 2. Testable Command Pattern
Create a command factory that allows injection:
```go
func NewTaskCommand(client api.ClientInterface) *cobra.Command {
    return &cobra.Command{
        Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
            // Use injected client
        },
    }
}
```

### 3. Error Handling Abstraction
Replace direct `os.Exit` with error returns that can be tested.

## Next Steps

### Continue Phase 2
1. Add more comprehensive tests for remaining commands
2. Test flag parsing and validation logic
3. Create integration tests using the mock infrastructure

### Move to Phase 3
1. Test output formatting package
2. Test error handling utilities
3. Test version package

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `internal/api/mock/client.go` - Mock API client
- `internal/api/mock/user_lookup.go` - Mock user lookup
- `internal/api/mock/fixtures.go` - Test fixtures
- `internal/cmd/config_test.go` - Config command tests
- `internal/cmd/task_test.go` - Task command tests
- `internal/cmd/list_test.go` - List command tests

### Key Patterns Established
1. Mock infrastructure for external dependencies
2. Command structure validation approach
3. Table-driven test patterns

## Conclusion

While we've made progress, the current architecture limits how much we can test without refactoring. The mock infrastructure is ready for when commands are refactored to support dependency injection. For now, we've established patterns and improved coverage by over 10 percentage points.
