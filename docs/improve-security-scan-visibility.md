# Improving Security Scan Visibility

## Current Issue

The current security scan in CI doesn't show errors in the workflow logs because:
1. GoSec outputs only to SARIF format (for GitHub Security tab)
2. No console output is generated
3. Failures are silent - you have to check the Security tab

## Understanding Security Scan Results

### Where to Find Results

1. **GitHub Security Tab**:
   - Go to Repository → Security → Code scanning alerts
   - Or check the PR's Checks tab for security annotations

2. **SARIF File**:
   - The scan creates `gosec-results.sarif` 
   - This is uploaded to GitHub's security infrastructure

### Common GoSec Issues

- **G101**: Hardcoded credentials (like our test tokens)
- **G104**: Unhandled errors
- **G304**: File path injection
- **G401**: Weak cryptography

## Quick Fix Applied

We fixed the immediate issue by adding `#nosec G101` comments to test fixtures:

```go
ValidToken = "pk_12345678_ABC..." // #nosec G101 - Test fixture
```

## Recommended CI Improvement

To make security issues visible in workflow logs, update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run gosec (Console Output)
  run: |
    go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
    echo "::group::Security Scan Results"
    ~/go/bin/gosec -fmt text ./... || echo "Security issues found (see details above)"
    echo "::endgroup::"
  continue-on-error: true

- name: Run gosec (SARIF)
  uses: securego/gosec@master
  with:
    args: -fmt sarif -out gosec-results.sarif ./...
```

This approach:
1. Shows issues immediately in the workflow logs
2. Still generates SARIF for the Security tab
3. Makes debugging much easier

## Alternative: Comprehensive Security Job

See `.github/workflows/security-scan-improvements.yml` for a complete example that includes:
- Console output with grouped results
- Job summary with issue counts
- Clear pass/fail status
- Links to detailed results

## Best Practices

1. **Use `#nosec` sparingly**: Only for false positives with explanation
2. **Review Security tab regularly**: Even if CI passes
3. **Fix issues promptly**: Security issues can block PRs
4. **Document exceptions**: Explain why certain warnings are suppressed
